## To calculate and cache matrix inversion to save time 


## This function creates a list containing functions to
#1.  set the value of the matrix
#2.  get the value of the matrix
#3.  set the value of the solved matrix
#4.  get the value of the solved matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the matrix
## returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
## already been calculated, then should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache.
## This function always asume that the matrix returnd by 
## 'makeCacheMatrix' is inversable

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
